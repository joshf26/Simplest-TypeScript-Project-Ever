# Simplest TypeScript Project Ever

For some reason, it's hard to find a TypeScript boilerplate that doesn't include linters, prettifiers, testing frameworks, etc. I just want to write TypeScript code and run it. This repo is the most basic TypeScript project I could possibly create.

To set this up:
1. Clone this repo, or download it as a zip and extract.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Write your code and run `npm start` to compile and run it.
